I don't believe in superstition, but I do believe in ritual, so tonight we're burning a yule "log" of holly, trimmed from out
own bushes.

We also trimmed a branch more-or-less at sundown that we'll leave to season for a full year to burn at next year's solstice. Tonight's burn is more of a preview of a tradition we'll start next year with a slightly larger and properly seasoned yule log.

Traditions give us a checkpoint in the passage of time so we don't get sweap away in it; rituals connect us to a larger picture, to the past and the future.
