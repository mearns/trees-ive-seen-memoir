Trees don't impose themselves on my childhood memories, but intertwine subtlely with the fuzzy images, the shadows, and
illusions.

The memories of climbing my grandfather's butternut tree to harvest the sticky green fruits is the type of memory that feels
like something we did recurrently. I suspect that, in fact, it was only a single time. In my mind, the tree is a giant; we
climbed its broad, outstretched branches like the rungs of a ladder to unthinkable heights. I could not have been more than six
years old at the time, so I'd be surprised if I was any higher than a short jump to my parents' outstretched hands. As for the true
height of the tree, it's lost to history and land deeds now, and I have little to go on except my field guide, suggesting it
might have reached to sixty feet; tall, but not gigantic.
