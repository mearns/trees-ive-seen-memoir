{TK syviculturists}, climate scientists, and historians study growth rings to learn about the lifetime of a tree. A
slice of a trunk, or a {TK core sample} extracted carefully with a drill, provides a timeline over the life of the tree detailing any
number of things that the tree would react to: the availability of water, the extremes of temperature, infection and infestation,
scars from fire and other damage, even prevailing winds. This flat, two dimensional surface encodes
like a hologram the details of a structure far more complex than its simple geometry would suggest.

{TK check on climates} In temperate climates, the tree goes through a season of rapid growth, followed (and preceeded) by a season
of more restricted growth. Rapid growth produces larger cells and lighter colored wood, slower growth produces smaller cells and
darker wood {TK check on that}. The growth occurs in the vascular cambium just under the bark, increasing the tree's diameter;
alternating seasons of growth thus produce alternating layers of light and dark wood expanding out from the center of the tree,
revealed by the unconcerned strokes of the chain saw as the familiar growth rings.

As Plato could tell us, these aren't rings at all, merely approximations of an ideal. The tree's growth is a product of a
virtual infinitude of factors that vary along axes of time and space, leading to uneven growth and an overall divergence from
the circular Form.

More to the point, the growth isn't ring-like at all, but cone-like, formed by a stack of rings (layers of cambium cells)
each a moment younger than the one below it. The younger rings have had less time to grow and are, within the limits imposed by
the multitudinous growth factors, slightly smaller, thus giving the shoot an overall taper from base to tip. The primary growth of the tree,
lengthening the trunk through cell division in the apical meristem at the tip of the shoot, far outpaces the secondary growth in
the cambium, leading to a very tall, very narrow cone with a taper so subtle as to be noticeable only in the aggregate. Taken
over a comparatively short length of the trunk, the taper is so slight that the cone segment can be reasonably approximated as
a cylander, and the log with its growth "rings" as a collection of nested cylanders.

Slice these cylanders along their diameters and you'll see the rectangular cross sections of the cylander walls neatly stacked
like book spines on a shelf. This is riftsawn lumber; the somewhat rare, sought-after output from a laborious and wasteful process that
cuts a log along its radius so the growth rings are all oriented the same way within the plank. Lumber expands and contracts
with changes in humidity primarily along the radius, so riftsawn planks suffer less warping than flatsawn.

Now imagine those concentric cylanders aren't cylanders, but vaguely-cylandrical, irregular forms, with bulges, dips, valleys,
pits, and ruts. The neatly stacked spines of your riftsawn bookshelf are deformed with water damage, but still generally
aligned.

Flatsawn lumber is much more economical to produce: all the cuts are made parallel to one another so the log is processed with
ease and minimal waste. That also means almost none of the cuts are along the radius. As the saw moves further out from the center of
the log, we get more and more disorientation of the growth rings: outer rings are cut closer to radially while inner rings
are cut more tangentially. The radial lines of the rings within the resulting plank are pointing in different directions, so
expansion occurs in different directions, leading to cupping and bowing.

But those near-tangential cuts expose biased cross sections of the growth cylanders, whose irregular forms intersect the plane
of the plank with irregular projections, drawing nested loops that merge and split on the face of the wood. The story they tell
is incomplete, rambling and even incoherent. The growthrings as read from a core sample or cross cut are a logitudinal study covering
the entire lifetime of the tree, but the face of flatsawn lumber are the hazy, meandering stories recalled at holiday dinners,
late nights at the pub, or memoirs like this one. The stories blend and blur, nest and recurse, in shapes that are at once
familiar and, when the craft is right and the conditions favorable, beguiling.
